# Denial of Service Attack on WiFi Networks

## Description

These scripts are made to execute a [Denial-of-Service](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-denial-service-attacks) (DoS) attack against a wireless network (i.e. they'll crash a wifi network). 

They will only run on [Kali Linux](https://www.kali.org/). I recommend creating a virtual machine and installing kali on the vm.




## Usage

**Please note: these scripts require a wireless adapter that supports both monitor mode and injection mode.**
(The wireless adapters in most laptops don't support monitor and injection modes.)

If you have a windows machine, you can test your wireless adapter's capabilities like this:

1. Open powershell or command prompt in administrator mode
2. run `netsh`
3. run `wlan show wirelesscapabilities`
4. In the list that's shown, Network monitor mode will show "Supported" or "Not Supported"

If your wireless adapter doesn't support these modes, you can buy one. [Click here for more info](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/select-field-tested-kali-linux-compatible-wireless-adapter-0180076/).
